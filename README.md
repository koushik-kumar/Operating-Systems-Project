# Projects
<h4> 1. Banker's Algorithm Implementation</h4>
<h4>2. Desgined a PID Manager that allocates a unique process identifier to 
        each process, using a data structure that represents the availability of 
        process identifiers that are safe from race conditions. </h4>

		- Used Pthreads mutex locks to to ensure that the data structure used to represent the availability of process identifiers is safe from race conditions and 
		- Used Bitmap data structure in which a value of 0 at position i indicates that a process id is available and a value of 1 indicates that the process id is currently in use.
